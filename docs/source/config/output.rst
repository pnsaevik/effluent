===============================
Output parameters
===============================

The output file contains the trajectory of the effluent jet for
different release times. The output parameters determine the
file format and the amount of data written. They affect the simulation process
as well, since the software only performs computations that are required for
the output.

.. confval:: output.variables

    :type: array of strings
    :default: (all variables)

    Variables to include in the output. Possible alternatives are:

    * ``release_time``: Time of release, relative to simulation start [s]
    * ``t``: Time since release from pipe outlet [s]
    * ``x``: Centerline *x* position (co-flow direction) [m]
    * ``y``: Centerline *y* position (crossflow direction) [m]
    * ``z``: Centerline *z* position (depth below surface) [m]
    * ``u``: Mean velocity in *x* direction [s]
    * ``v``: Mean velocity in *y* direction [s]
    * ``w``: Mean velocity in *z* direction [s]
    * ``density``: Mean mass density [kg/mÂ³]
    * ``radius``: Radius of top-hat profile [m]

.. confval:: output.resolution

    :type: number
    :units: s

    Time resolution of the ``t`` variable in the output file. This is not the
    same as the internal time step, which is chosen automatically by the
    integration algorithm.

|

.. confval:: output.stagnation

    :type: number
    :units: s

    The maximum value of ``t`` in the output file.
    This parameter determines the length of each simulation period.

|

.. confval:: output.frequency

    :type: number
    :units: s

    Time resolution of the ``release_time`` variable in the output file.
    This parameter determines the time interval between subsequent
    plume simulations.

|

.. confval:: output.stop

    :type: number
    :units: s

    The maximum value of ``release_time`` in the output file.
    This parameter determines when the subsequent plume simulations should be
    stopped.

|

.. confval:: output.csv.file

    :type: string

    Write results to the specified comma-delimited text file.
    Rows are sorted by ``release_time``, then by ``t``.

|

.. confval:: output.nc.file

    :type: string

    Write results to the specified file using the
    `netCDF4 format <https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/>`_. Output
    variables are structured with ``release_time`` as the first
    dimension and ``t`` as the second dimension.
