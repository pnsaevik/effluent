# effluent

Effluent is a python package for simulating the dispersion of effluent
discharges from wastewater pipes. The underlying model is based on
Lee, Joseph H. W., and Chu, Vincent H.: *Turbulent Jets and Plumes*.
Boston, MA: Springer US, 2003.
[doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-0407-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-0407-8).

The package is mainly intended for research purposes, and does not contain
any convenience plotting or statistics functionality. It is expected that
these analyses are conducted in post-processing stages using other packages.


## Installation

The package is installed using pip:

    pip install effluent

Alternatively, the package can be installed to an isolated conda environment
using the in-repo file `environment.yml` as follows:

    conda env create -f environment.yml 


## Usage

The software is invoked as a command line script:

    effluent config.toml

where `config.toml` is the configuration file specifying the simulation
setup. Examples of valid configuration files are given in the repository
directory `docs/source/examples`, and in the
[online documentation](https://effluent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
